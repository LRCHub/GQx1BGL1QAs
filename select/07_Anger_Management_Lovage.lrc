[00:13.35] My inner demons compel me to be here
[00:17.06] Your cheeks are flush like rose petals
[00:21.27] You're consumed with rage but i'm consumed with you
[00:46.77] 
[00:25.12] Our eyes intertwine through the haze
[00:30.21] Intoxicated by your bloodshot stare
[00:35.91] In all of my dreams i never thought i'd see
[00:43.54] A face that could launch a thousand ships
[01:04.04] 
[00:47.96] And the music was like wind in your hair
[00:53.92] The moonlight caressed your silhouette
[01:00.02] Kiss of ocean mist is in the air
[01:07.13] Why must god punish me this way
[01:22.63] 
[01:16.01] Lay down my hand the next move is yours
[01:19.87] As you undress me with your frozen eyes
[01:25.92] In all of my dreams I never thought I'd see
[01:33.73] An endless love to share my blue lagoon
[01:53.23] 
[01:38.93] And the music was like wind in your hair
[01:44.68] The moonlight caressed your silhouette
[01:51.15] Kiss of ocean mist is in the air
[01:57.99] Why must god punish me this way
[02:13.49] 
[02:32.54] Happiness is hard to come by
[02:34.89] But I've had my fair share
[02:37.68] The satin sheets, the lemon peels
[02:41.08] The minor keys, the major pills
[02:44.48] We've climbed the mountain, saw the top
[02:47.30] And planted the apple seed
[02:49.53] And can't you see we could've had it all
[03:09.53] 
[02:54.37] And the music was like wind in your hair
[03:00.56] The moonlight caressed your silhouette
[03:06.66] Kiss of ocean mist is in the air
[03:13.11] Why must God punish me this way
[03:28.61] 
[03:19.64] And the music was like wind in your hair
[03:25.72] The moonlight caressed your silhouette
[03:31.77] Kiss of ocean mist is in the air
[03:38.71] Why must god punish me this way
[03:50.95] Why must god punish me this way
[03:56.78] This way, this way, this way ...
