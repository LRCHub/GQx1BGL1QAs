Are you talking to me?!
My name isn't Girl!
Nor isn't Hey lovin me, come here baby
Give us a trust
I'm your mother, another, sister
You walk on the shore
I'ma barrel of life,
I come too far from the dead,
I was told to be for you to make a bitch out of me

My essence is my offense
(Let yourself be!)
My essence is my offense
(Let yourself feel!)
My essence is my offense
(Let yourself be!)
My essence is my offense
(Let yourself feel!)
